# Primitives

Primitives are special symbolic variables that are annotated with additional domain-specific metadata. Conductor.jl uses primitives to validate models and improve code generation.

Currently, Conductor.jl defines the following primitives:

* `MembranePotential`
* `ExtrinsicPotential`
* `IonConcentration`
* `IonCurrent`
* `EquilibriumPotential`
